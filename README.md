# GitHub-Battle
This is a project from Tyler Mcginnis' React course that i completed in the process of learning react.

It is a web app which displays the most popular GitHub repos by desired language, selected from the nav bar, when on the Popular page.
It allows a GitHub battle between 2 people with GitHub accounts, in the Battle page. The winner is selected based on their number of followers and their number of stars.
The Home page gives the option to redirect to the Battle page.

This is the course I completed:
